Example (UI change)

To Frontend Agent:


Task: Fix Photos onboarding.
Context: On Photos screen, user can continue without 4 photos.
Expected: Block Next until 4 photos uploaded, show message.
Actual: Next works with 0 photos.
Constraints: Don’t change backend APIs, don’t add dependencies.
Acceptance: Next disabled or blocked; message shown; works on emulator.
Verify: Run onboarding flow; confirm cannot proceed with <4.


***************************************************************************************************

Example (backend change)

To Backend Agent:


Task: When PATCH /api/users/me runs, onboarding_completed should not become True unless min profile rules satisfied.
Expected: Only set onboarding_completed=True when first_name, birth_date, gender, and >=4 photos exist.
Actual: It becomes True even with only firstName updated.
Constraints: No schema changes.
Verify: Patch only firstName -> onboarding_completed stays False. Patch full profile -> becomes True.

The right way to coordinate agents (best practice)
Use Lead Agent as the “communication hub”

You do this:

Tell Lead what you want:

“I want Photos onboarding fixed and flow stable”

Lead splits tasks and writes a mini spec:

Backend tasks

Frontend tasks

QA verification

You paste each spec into each agent conversation

This prevents mismatch.
