Blush Hour is a time-bound social discovery / dating app.
The core idea is limited-time interactions to avoid endless swiping and ghosting.

Core principles:

- No infinite chat
- Emotional safety
- Intentional connections
- Low cognitive overload

## 2. Core Features Built So Far
- Phone-based authentication (register/login)
- Profile creation and editing
- Web version working via Expo Web
- Chat Night feature (in progress)
- Talk Room UI (timer + engage button)

## 3. Tech Stack
Frontend:
- Expo (React Native)
- Expo Router
- Web + Android support
- AuthContext for auth state
- SecureStore (mobile) and localStorage (web)

Backend:
- FastAPI
- MongoDB (via Docker)

- JWT-based authentication
- CORS enabled for web ports

Infra / Dev:

## 4. Known Issues (Current)

## 6. Development Philosophy
- Web-first development
- Emulator and mobile later

- No random debugging

## 7. Agent System (Antigravity)
Agents used:
- Lead GPT (decision maker)
- Backend Agent
- Frontend Agent
- Realtime Agent
- QA Agent
- AI Agent (future)

Rules:
- Agents execute only assigned tasks
